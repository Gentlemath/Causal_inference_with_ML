# Causal Inference with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains part of my answer(may not be correct) to a homework of **Foundation of Machine Learning and AI - part one**, instructed by professor Victor Veitch. This part is about methods to estimate causal effects using machine learning techniques, which I like very much.

## 📝 Notebooks
- **ATT_Estimation_with_Machine_Learning.ipynb**: Demonstrates how to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using machine learning models.
- **Fairness.ipynb**: Investigates fairness issues in causal inference, analyzing potential biases in treatment effect estimation.

## 📄 Report
- **report.pdf**: Some interesting problems about causal inference.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To explore the notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gentlemath/Causal_inference_with_ML.git
   cd Causal_inference_with_ML
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the desired notebook (`.ipynb` file) to explore the analyses.
